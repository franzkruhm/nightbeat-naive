# nightbeat-naive
A naive Python implementation of https://github.com/eth-siplab/Nightbeat, let me know if it works.
This was tested on myself (at rest as there is no body movement filtering in this version of the code) and on synthetic data and is part of a much larger project.

Support is very much appreciated: [https://ko-fi.com/zanfr](https://ko-fi.com/zanfr)
